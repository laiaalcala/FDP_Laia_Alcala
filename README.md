## Data:
It contains all the preprocessed data in which the model will be applied
- ATAC-seq data:
  - ATAC_Sp1hyp_binary_table.txt: Binarized measure of chromatin state over the different stages of hematopoietic development in mice. A 0 value represents a closed status and a 1 value an open status.
  - ATAC_Sp1hyp_time.txt
  - ATAC_WT-time.txt
  - ATAC_WT_binary_table.txt
- ChIP-seq data:
  - ES_ChIP_binary_table.txt
  - ES_chip_binding_sp1_sp3_binary_matrix.txt
  - ES_fpkm_WT_Sp1hyp.txt
- RNA-seq data:
  - ge_comb_Sp1WT_Sp1hyp_fpkm.txt
  - ge_full_Sp1WT.txt
  - ge_full_Sp1hyp.txt
