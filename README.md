## Data:
It contains all the preprocessed data in which the model will be applied
- ATAC-seq data:
  - ATAC_Sp1hyp_binary_table.txt: Binary table containing the chromatin state over the 5 different time-points with hypomorph Sp1 TF. Rows are genes and columns are the time-points. A 0 value represents a closed status and a 1 value an open status.
  - ATAC_Sp1hyp_time.txt: Binarized measure of the chromatin state over the 4 time-points (it does not contain t=0) with hypomorph Sp1 TF. Rows are genes and columns are the time-points. A 0 value represents a closed status and a 1 value an open status.
  - ATAC_WT-time.txt: Binarized measure of the chromatin state over the 4 time-points (it does not contain t=0) with Wild Type Sp1 TF. Rows are genes and columns are the time-points. A 0 value represents a closed status and a 1 value an open status.
  - ATAC_WT_binary_table.txt: Binary table containing the chromatin state over the 5 different time-points with  Wild Type Sp1 TF. Rows are genes and columns are the time-points. A 0 value represents a closed status and a 1 value an open status.

- ChIP-seq data:
  - ES_ChIP_binary_table.txt: Binary table containing the interaction of the different TFs at ES time-point (t=0) with the genes. A 0 value means non-interaction and a 1 value means interaction.
  - ES_chip_binding_sp1_sp3_binary_matrix.txt: Binarized measure of the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 TFs for the different genes at ES time-point (t=0). A 0 value means non-binding and a 1 value means binding.
  - binary_tf.txt: Binary table containing the interaction of the different TFs at the 5 time-points with genes. A 0 value means non-interaction and a 1 value means interaction.
 
- RNA-seq data:
  - ge_full_Sp1WT.txt: Gene expression of genes over the 5 different time-points with Wild Type Sp1 TF (measured as FPKM).
  - ge_full_Sp1hyp.txt: Gene expression of genes over the 5 different time-points with hypomorph Sp1 TF (measured as FPKM).
  - ge_comb_Sp1WT_Sp1hyp_fpkm.txt: Table containing the gene expression of genes over the 5 different time-points with both Wild Type and hypomorph Sp1 TF (measured as FPKM).
  - ES_fpkm_WT_Sp1hyp.txt: Table containing the gene expression of genes at ES time-point (t=0) for both Wild Type and hypomorph Sp1 TF (measured as FPKM).
